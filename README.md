# CU Students Assistant

One of the significant challenges faced by students of Calicut University is the irregularity of exams held on different dates. For those who have back-papers, preparing for the supplementary exam amidst the rush of ongoing semester exams and other college activities becomes extremely difficult. Approximately 75 percent of students start preparing for the exam only two to three days before or even on the day of the exam itself. During this short time, their primary focus is on studying short notes and previous year question papers. While there are several study materials available through various sources, students often struggle to access them at the exact moment they need them.
With this project, our aim is to assist students by providing readily available notes and other study materials at their fingertips, utilizing the power of programming. Additionally, we offer other useful features, such as up-to-date university live exam announcements, timetable notifications, result notifications, and a Telegram bot that allows students to access materials effortlessly, without relying on others. They can easily search for the required study materials using the Telegram bot. Furthermore, there is an option to upload notes and other content for the benefit of other open contributors and teachers.
